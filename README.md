# House Price: Advanced Regression Techniques Project

## Overview

This repository hosts a comprehensive machine learning project developed during a university course, focusing on predicting house prices using advanced regression techniques. Originating from a Kaggle competition titled " House Price:Advanced Regression Techniques," this project encompasses the entire machine learning workflow, from initial data exploration to model deployment. This project was originaly done at a coolab notebook.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains the dataset used for the project, including training and test sets.
- **`ini_data_exploration.py`**: Initial data exploration script with visualization and preliminary analysis.
- **`feature_sel.py`**: Script for feature selection, detailing the features selected for each model used in this project.
- **`funct_feature_engineering/`**: Directory containing code for feature engineering, supporting the process outlined in `feature_sel.py`.
- **`model/`**: Directory hosting a class that encapsulates all the machine learning models and potentially useful functions.
- **`pipeline/`**: Automates the workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
- **`kaggle/`**: Submission files and scripts for Kaggle competition entries.
- **`lime/`**: Implementation of LIME for model interpretation, aiding in the understanding of model predictions on individual instances.
- **`main.py`**: The main script that integrates components of the project, enabling a streamlined execution of the entire workflow.
- **`house_price.ipynb`**: This Jupyter notebook contains the detailed workflow of the project, including data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, optimization, and results analysis. It represents the comprehensive journey of the project presented.
- **`report_class.pdf`**: The report submitted to the class, detailing the process followed to execute the project. It includes methodologies, results, and conclusions, providing a thorough overview of the project's outcomes. It's in catalan.
